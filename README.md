## Here in task_ml.py file contains all the ML models code .
### Novelty of My works below
#### (1) I used Logistic Regression as  a classifier
#### (2) I employed Naive Bayes Alogithm
#### (3) I Utilized KNN model
#### (4) I employed Keras Hyper parameter tuned Enhanced KNN model. 
#### (5) I Utilized an ensemble model integraing logistic regression, naive bayes, and KNN with CatBoost as meta learner . 
#### (6) Here  I implemented Decision tree calssifier with pre pruning techinque to mitigate overfitting issues.
#### (7) I also utilized Hyper parameter tuned (for max_depth) decision tree classifier .

## Utilized tools in task_ml.py 
#### colab Nvidia T4;  we use Scikit learn   ; WE used keras tunar ; Hyper parameter tunining using GreadSearch CV and RandomSearch CV ; We used Matplotlib 



## Here ini task_DL.py file contains 3 DL models codes 
#### (1) We used customized BERT model in this files 
#### (2) We used modified RoBERT model with 200 iteration  in this file
#### (3) We used modified RoBERT model with 500 iteration in this file 
#### (4) Finally we used Ensemble model integrating BERT and RoBERT model with CatBoost Meta learner
